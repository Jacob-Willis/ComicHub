# ComicHub
Is a basic project to demonstrate angular.

Make sure that you run (in the ClientApp directory):
* 'npm install json-server' to install the json-server for the mock server API
* 'npm install' - to initialise the node_modules file
* 'npm install angular' - to install Angular for the application to run
  
# How to run:

1. Run the json-server mock API:
  * Open Terminal
  * Navigate to `ClientApp/mock-data` in the app's root directory
  * Run `json-server --watch comics.json`
  
2. Run the client application:
  * Open a new terminal
  * Navigate to `ClientApp` in the app's root directory
  * Run `ng serve`
